The goal of hs92-historic-series is to create curated international trade data since 1962. This uses the HS92 trade classification wth 4 digits depth level.

Before 1988, this data uses SITC2 (>= 1976) and SITC1 (1962-1975) data. The source for this data is UN COMTRADE.

Instead of using CSV or RDS, the chosen format here is Apache Arrow, to force cross language and systems compatibility.
